      "have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round\n",
      "the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\n",

      "the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined\n",
      "with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\n",
      "which consisted of a single flaming beryl. boots which extended\n",
      "halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\n",
      "rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\n",

      "\n",

      "signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"fire!\" the\n",
      "word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of\n",
      "spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and\n",
      "servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"fire!\" thick clouds\n",
      "of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. i\n",
      "caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\n",
      "of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\n",
      "slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner\n",
      "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my\n",

      "he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i guessed as much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in\n",

      "determined to see which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for\n",
      "air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your\n",
      "chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how did that help you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on\n",

      "more than once taken advantage of it. in the case of the\n",
      "darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\n",
      "the arnsworth castle business. a married woman grabs at her baby;\n",
      "an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. now it was clear to\n",
      "me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\n",
      "to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it.\n",
      "the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting were\n",
      "enough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the\n",
      "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the\n",
      "right bell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a\n",
      "glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. when i cried out that it\n",
      "was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed\n",
      "from the room, and i have not seen her since. i rose, and, making\n",
      "my excuses, escaped from the house. i hesitated whether to\n",
      "attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\n",
      "come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to\n",

      "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be\n",
      "shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is\n",
      "probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the\n",

      "scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and\n",
      "open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before\n",
      "her flight. holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small\n",

      "be you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this,\n",
      "you made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became\n",
      "suspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\n",
      "old clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress\n",
      "myself. male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage\n",
      "of the freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one\n",
      "of the vacancies.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\"well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,\n",

      "the league was founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah\n",
      "hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. he was himself\n",
      "red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;\n",
      "so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\n",
      "fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the\n",
      "interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of\n",

      "would apply.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'you see it is\n",
      "really confined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had\n",
      "started from london when he was young, and he wanted to do the\n",

      "applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but\n",
      "real bright, blazing, fiery red. now, if you cared to apply, mr.\n",
      "wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be\n",

      "his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\n",
      "fleet street was choked with red-headed folk, and pope's court\n",
      "looked like a coster's orange barrow. i should not have thought\n",
      "there were so many in the whole country as were brought together\n",
      "by that single advertisement. every shade of colour they\n",
      "were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, irish-setter, liver, clay;\n",
      "but, as spaulding said, there were not many who had the real\n",
      "vivid flame-coloured tint. when i saw how many were waiting, i\n",
      "would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear\n",
      "of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed and\n",
      "pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\n",
      "to the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream\n",
      "upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back\n",
      "dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found\n",

      "as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in\n",
      "them which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem\n",
      "to be such a very easy matter, after all. however, when our turn\n",
      "came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of\n",

      "he released me. 'i perceive that all is as it should be. but we\n",

      "black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\n",
      "i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\n",
      "indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his\n",

      "he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously\n",
      "upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up\n",

      "the city branch of one of the principal london banks. mr.\n",

      "\"your french gold?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources\n",

      "unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. the\n",
      "crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between\n",
      "layers of lead foil. our reserve of bullion is much larger at\n",
      "present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\n",
      "directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"which were very well justified,\" observed holmes. \"and now it is\n",
      "time that we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"and sit in the dark?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and\n",

      "and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us\n",
      "some harm unless we are careful. i shall stand behind this crate,\n",
      "and do you conceal yourselves behind those. then, when i flash a\n",

      "compunction about shooting them down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case\n",
      "behind which i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front\n",
      "of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute\n",
      "darkness as i have never before experienced. the smell of hot\n",
      "metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready\n",
      "to flash out at a moment's notice. to me, with my nerves worked\n",
      "up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\n",

      "an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must\n",
      "have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs\n",
      "were weary and stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my\n",
      "nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my\n",
      "hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle\n",
      "breathing of my companions, but i could distinguish the deeper,\n",
      "heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin, sighing note\n",
      "of the bank director. from my position i could look over the case\n",
      "in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught the glint\n",
      "of a light.\n",
      "\n",
      "at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then\n",
      "it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,\n",
      "without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand\n",
      "appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the\n",
      "centre of the little area of light. for a minute or more the\n",
      "hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. then\n",
      "it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark\n",
      "again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between\n",
      "the stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending,\n",
      "tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon\n",
      "its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed\n",
      "the light of a lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\n",
      "boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand\n",
      "on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and\n",
      "waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. in another\n",
      "instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after\n",
      "him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face\n",
      "and a shock of very red hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it's all clear,\" he whispered. \"have you the chisel and the\n",
      "bags? great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i'll swing for it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the\n",
      "collar. the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of\n",
      "rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed\n",
      "upon the barrel of a revolver, but holmes' hunting crop came\n",
      "down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it's no use, john clay,\" said holmes blandly. \"you have no\n",
      "chance at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"so i see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"i fancy\n",
      "that my pal is all right, though i see you have got his\n",
      "coat-tails.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i\n",
      "must compliment you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and i you,\" holmes answered. \"your red-headed idea was very new\n",
      "and effective.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you'll see your pal again presently,\" said jones. \"he's quicker\n",

      "'please.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"all right,\" said jones with a stare and a snigger. \"well, would\n",
      "you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry\n",
      "your highness to the police-station?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that is better,\" said john clay serenely. he made a sweeping bow\n",
      "to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the\n",
      "detective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"really, mr. holmes,\" said mr. merryweather as we followed them\n",
      "from the cellar, \"i do not know how the bank can thank you or\n",
      "repay you. there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated\n",
      "in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts\n",
      "at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr.\n",
      "john clay,\" said holmes. \"i have been at some small expense over\n",
      "this matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond\n",
      "that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in\n",
      "many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of\n",
      "the red-headed league.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you see, watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning\n",
      "as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, \"it\n",
      "was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible\n",
      "object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of\n",
      "the league, and the copying of the 'encyclopaedia,' must be to get\n",
      "this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of\n",
      "hours every day. it was a curious way of managing it, but,\n",
      "really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. the method was\n",
      "no doubt suggested to clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his\n",
      "accomplice's hair. the 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw\n",
      "him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?\n",
      "they put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\n",
      "office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\n",
      "together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the\n",
      "week. from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for\n",
      "half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive\n",
      "for securing the situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but how could you guess what the motive was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a\n",
      "mere vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the\n",
      "man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his\n",
      "house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and\n",
      "such an expenditure as they were at. it must, then, be something\n",
      "out of the house. what could it be? i thought of the assistant's\n",
      "fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\n",
      "cellar. the cellar! there was the end of this tangled clue. then\n",
      "i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i\n",
      "had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in\n",
      "london. he was doing something in the cellar--something which\n",
      "took many hours a day for months on end. what could it be, once\n",
      "more? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel\n",
      "to some other building.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i\n",
      "surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was\n",
      "ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\n",
      "it was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the\n",
      "assistant answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had\n",
      "never set eyes upon each other before. i hardly looked at his\n",
      "face. his knees were what i wished to see. you must yourself have\n",
      "remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of\n",
      "those hours of burrowing. the only remaining point was what they\n",
      "were burrowing for. i walked round the corner, saw the city and\n",
      "suburban bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that i\n",
      "had solved my problem. when you drove home after the concert i\n",
      "called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank\n",
      "directors, with the result that you have seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and how could you tell that they would make their attempt\n",
      "to-night?\" i asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that\n",
      "they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson's presence--in other\n",
      "words, that they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential\n",
      "that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\n",
      "bullion might be removed. saturday would suit them better than\n",
      "any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.\n",
      "for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you reasoned it out beautifully,\" i exclaimed in unfeigned\n",
      "admiration. \"it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings\n",
      "true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"alas! i already\n",
      "feel it closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort\n",
      "to escape from the commonplaces of existence. these little\n",
      "problems help me to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and you are a benefactor of the race,\" said i.\n",
      "\n",
      "he shrugged his shoulders. \"well, perhaps, after all, it is of\n",
      "some little use,\" he remarked. \"'l'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre\n",

      "\"my dear fellow,\" said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side\n",
      "of the fire in his lodgings at baker street, \"life is infinitely\n",
      "stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. we\n",
      "would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere\n",
      "commonplaces of existence. if we could fly out of that window\n",
      "hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the\n",
      "roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the\n",
      "strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the\n",
      "wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and\n",
      "leading to the most outrã© results, it would make all fiction with\n",
      "its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\n",
      "unprofitable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and yet i am not convinced of it,\" i answered. \"the cases which\n",
      "come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and\n",
      "vulgar enough. we have in our police reports realism pushed to\n",
      "its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,\n",
      "neither fascinating nor artistic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\n",
      "realistic effect,\" remarked holmes. \"this is wanting in the\n",
      "police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the\n",
      "platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an\n",
      "observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. depend\n",
      "upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i smiled and shook my head. \"i can quite understand your thinking\n",
      "so,\" i said. \"of course, in your position of unofficial adviser\n",
      "and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout\n",
      "three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is\n",
      "strange and bizarre. but here\"--i picked up the morning paper\n",
      "from the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. here is the\n",
      "first heading upon which i come. 'a husband's cruelty to his\n",
      "wife.' there is half a column of print, but i know without\n",
      "reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. there is, of\n",
      "course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\n",
      "bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. the crudest of\n",
      "writers could invent nothing more crude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\"\n",
      "said holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"this\n",
      "is the dundas separation case, and, as it happens, i was engaged\n",
      "in clearing up some small points in connection with it. the\n",
      "husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the\n",
      "conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of\n",
      "winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\n",
      "them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely\n",
      "to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. take a\n",
      "pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that i have scored over\n",
      "you in your example.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in\n",
      "the centre of the lid. its splendour was in such contrast to his\n",
      "homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ah,\" said he, \"i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks.\n",

      "voice was gentle. he'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he\n",
      "was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,\n",
      "and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. he was always\n",
      "well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just\n",
      "as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"\n",

      "happened i would always be true to him. mother said he was quite\n",
      "right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.\n",
      "mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\n",
      "of him than i was. then, when they talked of marrying within the\n",
      "week, i began to ask about father; but they both said never to\n",
      "mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother\n",
      "said she would make it all right with him. i didn't quite like\n",

      "two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a\n",
      "four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the\n",
      "street. we got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler\n",
      "drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and\n",
      "when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one\n",
      "there! the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become\n",

      "separate us, i was always to remember that i was pledged to him,\n",
      "and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. it seemed\n",

      "half-mad to think of it, and i can't sleep a wink at night.\" she\n",

      "breast, like one who is utterly crushed. holmes stuck his feet up\n",
      "on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands\n",

      "\"the man married a woman very much older than himself for her\n",
      "money,\" said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\n",

      "sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have\n",
      "made a serious difference. it was worth an effort to preserve it.\n",
      "the daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate\n",
      "and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\n",
      "her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would\n",
      "not be allowed to remain single long. now her marriage would\n",
      "mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her\n",
      "stepfather do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of\n",
      "keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\n",
      "people of her own age. but soon he found that that would not\n",
      "answer forever. she became restive, insisted upon her rights, and\n",
      "finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain\n",
      "ball. what does her clever stepfather do then? he conceives an\n",
      "idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. with the\n",
      "connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,\n",
      "covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with\n",
      "a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\n",
      "into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\n",

      "other lovers by making love himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"we never\n",
      "thought that she would have been so carried away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"very likely not. however that may be, the young lady was very\n",
      "decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that\n",
      "her stepfather was in france, the suspicion of treachery never\n",
      "for an instant entered her mind. she was flattered by the\n",
      "gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the\n",
      "loudly expressed admiration of her mother. then mr. angel began\n",
      "to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\n",
      "far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. there\n",
      "were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the\n",
      "girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. but the\n",
      "deception could not be kept up forever. these pretended journeys\n",
      "to france were rather cumbrous. the thing to do was clearly to\n",
      "bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it\n",
      "would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and\n",
      "prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\n",
      "come. hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament, and\n",
      "hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening\n",
      "on the very morning of the wedding. james windibank wished miss\n",
      "sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to\n",
      "his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not\n",
      "listen to another man. as far as the church door he brought her,\n",
      "and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished\n",
      "away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\n",
      "four-wheeler and out at the other. i think that was the chain of\n",
      "events, mr. windibank!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes\n",
      "had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold\n",
      "sneer upon his pale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it may be so, or it may not, mr. holmes,\" said he, \"but if you\n",

      "you who are breaking the law now, and not me. i have done nothing\n",
      "actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door\n",

      "\n",
      "\"the law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said holmes, unlocking\n",

      "friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. by jove!\"\n",

      "here's a hunting crop handy, and i think i shall just treat\n",
      "myself to--\" he took two swift steps to the whip, but before he\n",
      "could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\n",

      "james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there's a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said holmes, laughing, as he\n",
      "threw himself down into his chair once more. \"that fellow will\n",
      "rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and\n",

      "\"well, of course it was obvious from the first that this mr.\n",

      "stepfather. then the fact that the two men were never together,\n",
      "but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\n",
      "suggestive. so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,\n",
      "which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. my\n",

      "to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\n",

      "\"one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne, and\n",

      "their saddles at the first volley. three of our boys were killed,\n",
      "however, before we got the swag. i put my pistol to the head of\n",
      "the wagon-driver, who was this very man mccarthy. i wish to the\n",
      "lord that i had shot him then, but i spared him, though i saw his\n",
      "wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every\n",
      "feature. we got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made\n",
      "our way over to england without being suspected. there i parted\n",
      "from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and\n",
      "respectable life. i bought this estate, which chanced to be in\n",
      "the market, and i set myself to do a little good with my money,\n",
      "to make up for the way in which i had earned it. i married, too,\n",
      "and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice.\n",
      "even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\n",

      "than i could suffer. i struck him down with no more compunction\n",
      "than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. his cry brought\n",
      "back his son; but i had gained the cover of the wood, though i\n",

      "someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis\n",
      "that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from\n",
      "america. as to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by\n",

      "case of pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and\n",
      "its fulfilment, in dundee it was only some three or four days.\n",
      "does that suggest anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"a greater distance to travel.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\n",
      "or men are is a sailing-ship. it looks as if they always send\n",
      "their singular warning or token before them when starting upon\n",
      "their mission. you see how quickly the deed followed the sign\n",
      "when it came from dundee. if they had come from pondicherry in a\n",
      "steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.\n",
      "but, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. i think that those\n",
      "seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which\n",

      "\n",
      "\"it is possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"more than that. it is probable. and now you see the deadly\n",
      "urgency of this new case, and why i urged young openshaw to\n",
      "caution. the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\n",
      "it would take the senders to travel the distance. but this one\n",
      "comes from london, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good god!\" i cried. \"what can it mean, this relentless\n",
      "persecution?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital\n",
      "importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. i think\n",
      "that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.\n",
      "a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\n",

      "\"'ku klux klan. a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to\n",
      "the sound produced by cocking a rifle. this terrible secret\n",
      "society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the\n",
      "southern states after the civil war, and it rapidly formed local\n",
      "branches in different parts of the country, notably in tennessee,\n",
      "louisiana, the carolinas, georgia, and florida. its power was\n",
      "used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of\n",
      "the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country\n",
      "of those who were opposed to its views. its outrages were usually\n",
      "preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\n",
      "but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some\n",
      "parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. on receiving this\n",
      "the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might\n",
      "fly from the country. if he braved the matter out, death would\n",
      "unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and\n",
      "unforeseen manner. so perfect was the organisation of the\n",
      "society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a\n",
      "case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\n",
      "impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the\n",
      "perpetrators. for some years the organisation flourished in spite\n",
      "of the efforts of the united states government and of the better\n",
      "classes of the community in the south. eventually, in the year\n",
      "1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\n",
      "been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you will observe,\" said holmes, laying down the volume, \"that\n",
      "the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\n",
      "disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers. it may\n",
      "well have been cause and effect. it is no wonder that he and his\n",
      "family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\n",
      "you can understand that this register and diary may implicate\n",

      "side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the third on the right is his,\" said the inspector. \"here it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"he is asleep,\" said he. \"you can see him very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his\n",
      "face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and\n",
      "heavily. he was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his\n",
      "calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his\n",
      "tattered coat. he was, as the inspector had said, extremely\n",
      "dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its\n",
      "repulsive ugliness. a broad wheal from an old scar ran right\n",
      "across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up\n",
      "one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a\n",
      "perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red hair grew low over\n",
      "his eyes and forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he's a beauty, isn't he?\" said the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he certainly needs a wash,\" remarked holmes. \"i had an idea that\n",
      "he might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\"\n",
      "he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my\n",
      "astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"he! he! you are a funny one,\" chuckled the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\n",

      "figure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, i don't know why not,\" said the inspector. \"he doesn't\n",
      "look a credit to the bow street cells, does he?\" he slipped his\n",
      "key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the\n",
      "sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep\n",
      "slumber. holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,\n",
      "and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the\n",
      "prisoner's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to mr. neville st. clair, of\n",

      "\n",
      "never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man's face peeled\n",
      "off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the\n",
      "coarse brown tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had\n",
      "seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the\n",
      "repulsive sneer to the face! a twitch brought away the tangled\n",
      "red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,\n",
      "sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,\n",
      "rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.\n",
      "then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and\n",
      "threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing\n",
      "man. i know him from the photograph.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons\n",
      "himself to his destiny. \"be it so,\" said he. \"and pray what am i\n",
      "charged with?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of\n",
      "it,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"well, i have been\n",
      "twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime\n",

      "finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london. one day\n",
      "my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the\n",
      "metropolis, and i volunteered to supply them. there was the point\n",
      "from which all my adventures started. it was only by trying\n",
      "begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to\n",
      "base my articles. when an actor i had, of course, learned all the\n",
      "secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for\n",
      "my skill. i took advantage now of my attainments. i painted my\n",
      "face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good\n",
      "scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a\n",
      "small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. then with a red head of\n",
      "hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the business\n",
      "part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a\n",
      "beggar. for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned\n",
      "home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no\n",
      "less than 26s. 4d.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,\n",

      "served upon me for 25 pounds. i was at my wit's end where to get\n",
      "the money, but a sudden idea came to me. i begged a fortnight's\n",
      "grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,\n",
      "and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise. in\n",
      "ten days i had the money and had paid the debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\n",

      "a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on\n",
      "the ground, and sitting still. it was a long fight between my\n",
      "pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and i threw up\n",
      "reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first\n",
      "chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets\n",

      "money. i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london\n",
      "could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average\n",
      "takings--but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making\n",
      "up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by\n",
      "practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city.\n",
      "all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\n",

      "coming up to me. i heard her voice downstairs, but i knew that\n",
      "she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off my clothes, pulled on\n",
      "those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. even a wife's\n",
      "eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but then it\n",
      "occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that\n",
      "the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening\n",
      "by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in\n",

      "better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,\n",
      "and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up\n",

      "stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her\n",
      "fate. it was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a\n",
      "gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. a\n",
      "brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow\n",
      "white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the\n",
      "left-hand side of the window. these articles, with two small\n",
      "wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save\n",
      "for a square of wilton carpet in the centre. the boards round and\n",
      "the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\n",
      "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building\n",
      "of the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\n",

      "his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining\n",
      "minutely the cracks between the boards. then he did the same with\n",
      "the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. finally he\n",
      "walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and\n",
      "in running his eye up and down the wall. finally he took the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"how very absurd! i never noticed that before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"very strange!\" muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. \"there are\n",
      "one or two very singular points about this room. for example,\n",

      "room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated\n",
      "with the outside air!\"\n",

      "the inner apartment.\"\n",

      "armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a\n",
      "round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things\n",

      "his lens in his pocket. \"hullo! here is something interesting!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on\n",
      "one corner of the bed. the lash, however, was curled upon itself\n",

      "reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me\n",
      "that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not\n",
      "come either from the window or the door. my attention was\n",
      "speedily drawn, as i have already remarked to you, to this\n",
      "ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. the\n",
      "discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to\n",
      "the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\n",
      "there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and\n",
      "coming to the bed. the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,\n",
      "and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\n",
      "furnished with a supply of creatures from india, i felt that i\n",
      "was probably on the right track. the idea of using a form of\n",
      "poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical\n",
      "test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless\n",
      "man who had had an eastern training. the rapidity with which such\n",
      "a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be\n",
      "an advantage. it would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could\n",
      "distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\n",
      "the poison fangs had done their work. then i thought of the\n",
      "whistle. of course he must recall the snake before the morning\n",
      "light revealed it to the victim. he had trained it, probably by\n",
      "the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.\n",
      "he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he\n",
      "thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the\n",
      "rope and land on the bed. it might or might not bite the\n",
      "occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\n",
      "sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his\n",

      "the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary\n",
      "in order that he should reach the ventilator. the sight of the\n",
      "safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to\n",
      "finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. the metallic\n",

      "hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\n",

      "held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\n",
      "i could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which\n",
      "the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich\n",
      "material. she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as\n",
      "though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\n",
      "gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\n",

      "across to the window, hoping that i might catch some glimpse of\n",
      "the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded\n",
      "across it. it was a wonderfully silent house. there was an old\n",
      "clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\n",
      "everything was deadly still. a vague feeling of uneasiness began\n",
      "to steal over me. who were these german people, and what were\n",

      "where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford, that was\n",
      "all i knew, but whether north, south, east, or west i had no\n",
      "idea. for that matter, reading, and possibly other large towns,\n",

      "returning home. obviously something had occurred during the\n",

      "something be? she could not have spoken to anyone when she was\n",
      "out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. had she\n",
      "seen someone, then? if she had, it must be someone from america\n",

      "her plans so completely. you see we have already arrived, by a\n",
      "process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\n",
      "american. then who could this american be, and why should he\n",
      "possess so much influence over her? it might be a lover; it might\n",

      "so as to wake a household. what did they say, then, of the\n",
      "disappearance of these gems?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture\n",
      "in the hope of finding them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"have they thought of looking outside the house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. the whole garden has\n",
      "already been minutely examined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"now, my dear sir,\" said holmes, \"is it not obvious to you now\n",
      "that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you\n",
      "or the police were at first inclined to think? it appeared to you\n",
      "to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. consider\n",
      "what is involved by your theory. you suppose that your son came\n",
      "down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,\n",
      "opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main\n",
      "force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,\n",
      "concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that\n",
      "nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six\n",
      "into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger\n",
      "of being discovered. i ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but what other is there?\" cried the banker with a gesture of\n",
      "despair. \"if his motives were innocent, why does he not explain\n",
      "them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is our task to find that out,\" replied holmes; \"so now, if\n",
      "you please, mr. holder, we will set off for streatham together,\n",

      "details.\"\n",

      "my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\n",
      "which i was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy\n",

      "confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be\n",
      "as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still i had such\n",
      "faith in holmes' judgment that i felt that there must be some\n",
      "grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\n",
      "explanation. he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the\n",
      "southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his\n",
      "hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. our client\n",
      "appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope\n",
      "which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\n",
      "desultory chat with me over his business affairs. a short railway\n",
      "journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank, the modest\n",
      "residence of the great financier.\n",
      "\n",
      "fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing\n",
      "back a little from the road. a double carriage-sweep, with a\n",
      "snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates\n",
      "which closed the entrance. on the right side was a small wooden\n",
      "thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges\n",
      "stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\n",
      "tradesmen's entrance. on the left ran a lane which led to the\n",
      "stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a\n",
      "public, though little used, thoroughfare. holmes left us standing\n",
      "at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\n",
      "front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden\n",
      "behind into the stable lane. so long was he that mr. holder and i\n",
      "went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should\n",
      "return. we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and\n",
      "a young lady came in. she was rather above the middle height,\n",
      "slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against\n",
      "the absolute pallor of her skin. i do not think that i have ever\n",
      "seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. her lips, too, were\n",
      "bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. as she swept\n",
      "silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of\n",
      "grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\n",
      "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong\n",
      "character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. disregarding\n",
      "my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand\n",
      "over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you have given orders that arthur should be liberated, have you\n",
      "not, dad?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but i am so sure that he is innocent. you know what woman's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "the coronet in his hand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. oh, do, do take\n",
      "my word for it that he is innocent. let the matter drop and say\n",

      "down from london to inquire more deeply into it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"this gentleman?\" she asked, facing round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, his friend. he wished us to leave him alone. he is round in\n",
      "the stable lane now.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "hope to find there? ah! this, i suppose, is he. i trust, sir,\n",
      "that you will succeed in proving, what i feel sure is the truth,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i fully share your opinion, and i trust, with you, that we may\n",
      "prove it,\" returned holmes, going back to the mat to knock the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i see. you infer that she may have gone out to tell her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"yes; when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i\n",

      "\"yes, he did.\"\n",

      "\"and he is a man with a wooden leg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive\n",

      "holmes' thin, eager face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i should be very glad now to go upstairs,\" said he. \"i shall\n",

      "he walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at\n",
      "the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.\n",
      "this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill\n",

      "he laid it upon the table. it was a magnificent specimen of the\n",
      "jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i\n",

      "without result. \"i feel it give a little,\" said he; \"but, though\n",

      "after the other. i followed them up and found they led to the\n",
      "hall window, where boots had worn all the snow away while\n",

      "cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so\n",

      "quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them\n",

      "her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her to\n",
      "sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use\n",
      "her money. when she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until\n",
      "she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. then\n",
      "she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\n",

      "\"ah,\" said holmes, \"i think that what you have been good enough\n",

      "\n",
      "\"yes, sir.\"\n",
